You can back up and restore an EDB database using Commvault Backup & Recovery.

## Using Commvault Backup & Recovery

Commvault provides two methods of taking the backup from an EDB database and restoring it:

-  DumpBasedBackupSet backup and restore
-  FSBasedBackupSet backup and restore

!!! Note
    At this time there's a known issue with FSBased Restore that doesn't allow for proper restoration of the database. See [Known issues](#known-issues) for more information. 

### DumpBasedBackupSet backup and restore

Dump-based backup uses the pg_dump utility to take the backup.

#### Taking DumpBasedBackupSet backup 

1. Open the Commvault Backup & Recovery's Command Center. From the navigation pane, select **Protect > Databases**.

2. Select the required instance.

3. In the **Backup sets** section, select **DumpBasedBackupSet**.

4. In the **Database groups** section, select the database group that you want to back up. In this case it's **default**.

5. In the **Backup** section, select **Back up now**.

6. in the Select Backup Level screen, select **Full**.

   A job is created to take the backup.

8. When the backup job is complete, its status changes to Completed.

#### Restoring DumpBasedBackupSet backup 

You can use DumpBasedBackupSet to restore the individual databases.

1. From the navigation pane, select **Protect > Databases**.
2. Select the instance that you want to restore.
3. In the **Recovery points** calendar, select **DumpBasedBackupSet**.

4. Select a date from the calendar, and then select **Restore**.
5. The Backup Content screen displays the databases to restore. Select the required database to restore or select all of them to restore all.

6. Select **Restore**.
7. From the **Restore Options** screen, select the destination server and destination instance. Then select **Submit**.

   A job is created to restore the backup.

8. When the Restore has completed successfully, log in to the EDB database and check that the restore operation recovered the data. This example connected to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance:

## Known issues
FSBaseBackupSet restore has an issue if the default edb directory, for example, `*:\Program files\edb`, was lost or deleted. If this occurs, then after a restore is performed, the permissions on the restored directories aren't recovered. Instead, the directory inherits the permissions from the parent directory, which doesn't allow EDB Postgres Advanced Server services to start on the restored directory. We're working with Commvault to resolve the issue.
